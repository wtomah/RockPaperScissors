## Rock, Paper, Scissors

A childhood game that is played among all ages. In this project, the user will play against a computer in order to win.

## Current Progress

This project is currently developed in Java. As of right now, the user will enter a main menu and have the choice of starting a game or exiting. Once starting the game, the player will pick between 1, 2, or 3 (rock, scissors, paper) and the computer will randomly chose among those numbers. The outputs that will appear will either be "Player 1 wins", "Player 2 wins" or "Tie". After this output, the program will end.

## Incoming Features
I plan on adding a submenu within the "Start A Game" selection so that the player may choose between "Single", "Best of 3", "Best of 5" or "Best of 7". I will be adding a database so that players may keep track of their record against the computer. After the backend and database are running efficiently, I will develop the frontend.
