## Rock, Paper, Scissors

A childhood game that is played among all ages. In this project, the user will play against a computer in order to win.

## Current Progress

This project is currently developed in Java. 


Upon running the program, the main menu will appear with the option to "1. Play Game" or "2. Exit". Selecting "Play Game" will direct you to a submenu that gives you a range of options. "1. Single Game", "2. Best of 3", "3. Best of 5", "4. Best of 7", "5. Back to Main Menu", and "6. Exit" are the currrent available options for this submenu. Once starting the game, the player will pick between 1, 2, or 3 (rock, scissors, paper) and the computer will randomly chose among those numbers. The outputs that will appear will either be "Player 1 wins", "Player 2 wins" or "Tie". After this output, the program will end.

## Incoming Features
I will be adding a database so that players may keep track of their record against the computer. After the backend and database are running efficiently, I will develop the frontend.
